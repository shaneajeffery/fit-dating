This was a prototype that I was helping a friend think through and I got a good amount of the code done before she shelved the idea.  The concept was building a dating app / website that was geared towards people whose top priority was being active / fitness.

It is a Node backend with GraphQL and React Native to handle the mobile.  Never got to the web frontend because I was eager to jump into React Native and learn that as my day job is in React already.

Now it is just code for prospective employers and peers to sift through!
